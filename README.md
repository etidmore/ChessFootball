CHESS-FOOTBALL HYBRID: OFFICIAL RULES v2.0 (UPDATED)

1. CORE CONCEPT
A tactical football game played with modified chess pieces on a realistic football field.
Strategy and precise positioning determine outcomes through resource management and 
tactical abilities. Teams advance a ball into the opponent's end zone using specialized 
pieces with unique football abilities.

2. BOARD & SCALE
Size:                48 × 16 squares (6×2 chessboards)
Real-world Scale:    120 yards × 40 yards
Positions per square: NW, NE, Center, SW, SE
End Zones:           Rows 1–4 and 45–48
Scale:               1 square = 2.5 yards

3. TEAM COMPOSITION
- 7 pieces per team: 6 Standard + 1 Captain
- 1 Captain per team (chosen from 8 specialized roles)
- Teams alternate between Offense (QB role) and Defense (Safety role)

4. MOVEMENT SYSTEM
Movement Restrictions (direction change costs 1 movement):
- The Fast (3 squares)
- Safety (Fast Captain)
- Deep Threat (Fast Captain)

- Strong (2 squares)
- QB (1 square)

- Movement Order: Captain → Heavy → Strong → Fast
- Retreat Ability: Heavy pieces may move up to 2 squares toward own QB (1 movement)

5. TURN STRUCTURE
The Snap (First Turn - Concurrent):
  - Planning Phase: Both teams use 7×3 grid whiteboards
  - Reveal Phase: Both reveal simultaneously
  - Execution Phase:
      - Offense executes all moves
      - Then Defense executes all moves
      - Abilities resolve as moves complete

Reaction Turns (Subsequent - Sequential):
  - Offense moves all pieces
  - Defense moves all pieces
  - Ball moves (teleports if pass successful)

Movement Planning Board:
  - Embossed Whiteboard (7×3):
    Column 1: Order (1st–7th)
    Column 2: Piece (ID or name)
    Column 3: Action (Destination, ability use)

6. TACKLING SYSTEM
- No dice. Tackling is deterministic.
- Tackle Trigger: Defender ends on same square + position as ball carrier
- Tackle Result: Immediate end of down, ball spotted at tackle point

Special Tackles:
| Type     | Condition                             | Result                                   |
|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Safety   | Tackle in own end zone (Rows 1–4/45–48)| +2 points to defense; offense restarts   |
| Sack     | Tackle behind line of scrimmage        | Ball spotted there; offense loses down   |

7. DOWNS & PROGRESS
- Start of Drive: Always from Square 8 (20-yard line)

- First Down Line: LOS + 4 squares (10 yards)
- 4 downs to gain 10 yards

4th Down Options:
| Option     | Result                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Go for it  | Normal play; failure = turnover at spot     |
| Punt       | Declare pre-turn; opponent starts at Square 8

8. SCORING
| Type        | Action                            | Points | Restart              |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------------|
| Touchdown   | Ball enters opponent’s end zone   | 7      | Opponent at Square 8 |
